    This function provides the easiest way to create an unsigned transaction.

    All coin values are in satoshis.

    spendables:
        a list of Spendable objects, which act as inputs. These can
        be either a Spendable or a Spendable.as_text or a Spendable.as_dict
        if you prefer a non-object-based input (which might be easier for
        airgapped transactions, for example).
    payables:
        a list where each entry is a bitcoin address, or a tuple of
        (bitcoin address, coin_value). If the coin_value is missing or
        zero, this address is thrown into the "split pool". Funds not
        explicitly claimed by the fee or a bitcoin address are shared as
        equally as possible among the split pool. [Minor point: if the
        amount to be split does not divide evenly, some of the earlier
        bitcoin addresses will get an extra satoshi.]
    fee:
        a value, or "standard" for it to be calculated.
    version:
        the version to use in the transaction. Normally 1.
    lock_time:
        the lock_time to use in the transaction. Normally 0.

    Returns the unsigned Tx transaction. Note that unspents are set, so the
    transaction can be immediately signed.
