Version 0.40
------------

This is a pretty major overhaul... sorry for broken API!

* added MANIFEST.in
* initial support for Litecoin and Dogecoin addresses

New Scripts:
* ku (keys & BIP32 manipulation), replaces bu/bitcoin_utils and genwallet
* tx (transaction manipulation), replaces spend
* fetch_unspent command-line tool
* cache_tx to add a transaction to local cache
* block (to dump contents of a block)

Keys:
* added Key class with alt coin support
* renamed Wallet.py to bip32.py

Tx:
* massive overhaul of Tx class
* remove UnsignedTx class, folding functionality into Tx
* partial signing supported by Tx
* added Spendable class
* Tx objects can now optionally be augmented with data about source coins ("unspents")
  * if this data is set, many new methods can be called related to signing or verifying
  * easy integration with TxDB class to set unspents
* deterministic signing of TxIn according to RFC6979
* limit S values in preparation for version 3 transactions
* tx_utils helper to make it dead simple to create new, signed transactions
  * create_tx and create_signed_tx

Services:
* new support for blockr.io and biteasy.com
* services now integrated with environment variables:
   * PYCOIN_SERVICE_PROVIDERS
   * PYCOIN_CACHE_DIR
* a new TxDB class
   * looks like a dictionary
   * transparently uses configured services
   * caches fetched transactions

* improvements to "spend" command-line utility
* added some blockchain.info utilities

* rename public_pair_from_sec to sec_to_public_pair

Version 0.20
------------

Version 0.13
------------

* first crack at support for Python 2.7
* rename ripemd160_sha256 to hash160
* add a bunch of pydoc comments
* first crack at genwallet.py utility (need a better name)
* very preliminary crack at spend.py utility
* reduce Tx database that's required to be passed to the "sign" method
  to include bare minimum of data (the output script for a given hash/index)
* change ":pub" keypath suffix to ".pub" (still not sure about this)
* lots of refactoring, parameter renaming, moving things around
  related to signing and verifying transactions. Better, but still
  not perfect.
