# Installation

To install pycoin, run this command in the terminal:

```
$ pip install pycoin
```

If you don't have [pip](https://pip.pypa.io) installed, check out
[this tutorial](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/starting/installation/).

To see if pycoin is correctly installed, try a command-line tool:

```
$ ku 1
```

You should see several lines of output, describing information about the
bitcoin key corresponding to private key 1.
