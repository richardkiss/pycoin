Wallet
================

a wallet is a DB of Spendable objects, and a way to query and manage them

The wallet accepts pycoinnet bitcoin events (_blockchain_update and _mempool_tx)
and decides for itself which Spendable objects its interested in.

Ideally, it should keep an archive of all Spendable objects its ever received so it can
handle as many _blockchain_update rollbacks as it would like to.

It should also keep a DB of all the transactions it's ever created, so it can watch for
morphed versions (modulo malleability)
